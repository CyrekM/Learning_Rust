# Learinging_Rust

## I am going through The Rust Book and performing the excercises

With this project I want to present my progress through The Rust programming language using The Rust Book, Rust by Example, and Rustlings.

This is specifically for my learning purposes for future projects.

## TODO

* Go through Chapters 1 & 2 of The Rust book. 
* Annotate my understand of the process within the code as I go along.
* Create my own small applications based on my understandings.
